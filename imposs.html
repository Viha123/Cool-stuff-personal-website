        So this is very similar to a bucket list. But it's not. The reason is because a bucket list just feels like something I am going to do some random time in the future. This list on the other hand is supposed to be NOW! I've come to realize that if I need to do anything at all, it's going to have to be now. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, I created this list, which is inspired from Thomas Frank's List. This would help me consciously think about the things that I want to do and hopefully give me more motivation to work on it.
