                I truly don’t like that my first blog on this website, is about such a terrible topic, but I feel that I have some things to say and some connections to make, that I don’t necessarily want to leave unsaid. I don’t expect many people to read this, but I hope that I can convince the few who do about how utterly unnecessary the ongoing political situation is. <br><br>

                A lot on the topic of war is already been said, so I’ll just really quickly give you a rundown on the current political reality. Russia has attacked Ukraine with the intent to conquer.  Russia has been keeping military on the Russia-Ukraine border for quite a while now. A little background on both these countries: Russia and Ukraine have very similar cultures and history, and so Russia expects Ukraine to follow suit with it’s communist agenda, however, Ukraine is starting to become very Democratic, hoping to eventually join NATO. NATO is a conference of western countries, and at this point its like the “Cool kids club”. Russia is obviously the bully that doesn’t want Ukraine to be part of this club, and so it does the most natural thing that any bully does, it attacks. (I realize that I am being very biased with this analogy here, and I do understand Russia’s point of view, but at this point, the focus of this blog is different) <br><br>

                Keeping the above story in mind, I want to share an interesting story. A couple months ago I was reading this mystery-thriller type book called, “Never”, by Ken Follett. At the time I read the book, I hated it, and I thought it was a pretty stupid piece of crap with a really bad ending. I don’t want to spoil the book, but basically the gist was that United States and China get into a war that both of them don’t actually want. They both are escalating a situation far beyond what is required and what they can control. Again, at that time I thought it was extremely stupid, but with the impending situation with Russia and Ukraine, I have come to realize, how precariously the world power is resting. I certainly hope that the following scenario doesn’t happen, but war can escalate very very quickly, and although unlikely, Russia invading Ukraine may just be a Mark Robber domino that ends in a huge blast.  My reason for writing this is to make people realize how precarious this situation is and hope that we don’t remain bystanders and speak and get involved when it is most required, because, at the end of the day, this is humanity’s future that we are talking about. <br> <br>

                I will leave you a quote that has very heavily shaped my view of war, and I hope you find it thought provoking too,<br>
